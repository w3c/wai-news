[Digital Publishing ARIA (DPUB-ARIA) 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-aria/) and [Digital Publishing Accessibility APIs Mapping (DPUB-AAM) 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-aam/)  are now Candidate Recommendation Snapshots. DPUB-ARIA defines a set of WAI-ARIA roles specific to helping users of assistive technologies navigate through document structural divisions, for example in ebooks. DPUB-AAM states how accessibility application programming interfaces (APIs) should map these roles. Changes from DPUB 1.0 include the addition of `doc-pageheader` and `doc-pagefooter` roles. Additional changes are in the [DPUB-ARIA changelog](https://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-aria/#changelog) and [DPUB-AAM changelog](https://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-aam/#changelog). Please submit any comments by 27 April 2024. For an introduction to WAI-ARIA and related resources, see the [WAI-ARIA Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/).
